description: An interactive Calculus III course.
---

This course provides an introduction to vector calculus and assumes familiarity with techniques/concepts from Calculus I, II. Starting with the elementary geometry of two- and three-space, we develop the calculus of vector-valued functions and multi-variables. We discuss parametrized space curves, limits of multi-variables functions, derivatives and the chain rule, and multi-variable integration.
